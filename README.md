### Hi there, my name is Bruno ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a full stack developer living in Graz, Austria. I have experience working on front-end and back-end positions with React, Node.js and C# (among others) and I speak fluent German and English.

I'm eager to learn new things ðŸŒ± and motivated to build great things together ðŸ‘¯

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently open to work on new challenges either in Styria, Austria or remote!

âš¡ In my free time, I combine my interest for hockey with my passion for software development by developing [hockey deep dive](https://hockeydeepdive.site/).
