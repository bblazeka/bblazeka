### Hi there, my name is Bruno 👋

I’m a full stack developer living in Graz, Austria. I have experience working on front-end and back-end positions with React, Node.js and C# (among others) and I speak fluent German and English.

I'm eager to learn new things 🌱 and motivated to build great things 👯

<!--🔭 I’m currently open to work on new challenges either in Styria, Austria or remote!-->

<!--⚡ In my free time, I combine my interest for hockey with my passion for software development by developing [hockey deep dive](https://hockeydeepdive.site/).-->
